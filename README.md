I am currently working at [the Ogata Lab](https://cls.kuicr.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en/) of [Kyoto University](https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/en) as an assistant professor.  
I aim to understand the role of giant viruses (i.e., the viral phyla "[Nucleocytoviricota](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwj0k5Ogr-GEAxX_m68BHaCUCLgQFnoECDUQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FNucleocytoviricota&usg=AOvVaw0gbPsn6g-N0t75RIj8bkkl&opi=89978449L)" and "[Mirusviricota](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05962-4)") in the global marine ecosystem and to find evidence of how these viruses influence the evolution of their eukaryotic hosts.  
Benefiting from the development of various sequencing methods, I can see the light getting brighter in the dark room. And I am fortunate to be in a position to work on a database for [KEGG](https://www.kegg.jp), where I am surrounded by "unknowns".
