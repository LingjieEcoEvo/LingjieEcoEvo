### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Introduction
Thank you for being here!:city_sunset:
I am currently working at Kyoto University as an assistant professor. I aim to understand the role of giant viruses (i.e., the viral phyla "Nucleocytoviricota" and "Mirusviricota") in the global marine ecosystem and to find evidence of how these viruses influence the evolution of their eukaryotic hosts.
Benefiting from the development of various sequencing methods, I can see the light getting brighter in the dark room. And I am fortunate to be in a position to work on a database for KEGG, where I am surrounded by "unknowns".
